# Ink-Owlbook
An unofficial collection of community-sourced examples, tips and tricks for Ink.

## *Where is the Ink Owlbook?*

[The Ink Owlbook can be found here.](https://github.com/Liance/Ink-Owlbook/blob/main/Ink-Owlbook.md) 

## *What is the Ink Owlbook?*

The Ink Owlbook is meant to be a common-sense cookbook full of useful Ink snippets, tips and tricks. It's aimed at anyone who's already gotten their feet wet with Ink, and is now looking for ways to push their knowledge, or feels like an FAQ would be useful. The Owlbook won't be as useful if you're just starting out with Ink - the [Unofficial Ink Cookbook](https://github.com/videlais/Unofficial-Ink-Cookbook) or [official beginner's tutorial](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/) are great resources for learning Ink from scratch.

## *Why is it called the owlbook?*

Because an [Unofficial Ink Cookbook](https://github.com/videlais/Unofficial-Ink-Cookbook) already exists, and owls are cool, so we decided to call this the Ink Owlbook. (The Unofficial Ink Cookbook is a fantastic place to learn Ink fundamentals!)
